# freecodecamp

This repository contains all of the 5 challenges that are required to pass the Scientific Computing with Python course at Freecodecamp. The course is an estimated investment of 300 hours of study. I took this course to both refresh my understanding of basic Python features and because I thought the challenges looked both interesting and fun. The course was indeed fun, challenging and rewarding. I learned some new Python features, and got to really drill my existing skills. Amazing you can find content this good to teach yourself skills for free!
